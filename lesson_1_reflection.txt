How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    As it pin point where changes are made

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It help us to know what changes are made 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	pros - It help me to commit when i need and when there is a logical sepration between bugs;
	cons - some time i will forget to commit then it will cause problem

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is good for programmer as any program have many files .

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log give all detail about all the commit done on that program , so we can know what were
	changes made on each commit , and also compare two commit with the help of git diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    it help to know what change we make in each commit and so we can find the commit responsible for bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i want to make my project which is 2048 game
